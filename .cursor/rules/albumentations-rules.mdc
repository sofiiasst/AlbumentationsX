# Your rule content

- get_params_dependent_on_data should look minimal, but should look small and clear as we just call other functions from it
- we do not use fill_value, but fill. Not fill_mask_value, but fill_mask
- We do not have ANY default values in the InitSchema class
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize for parameterized tests
- In the code, when need default value use 137, not 42
- NEVER create temporary tests. If you need to create a test, it mean that existing test suite is not good enough => add permanent test to tests.
